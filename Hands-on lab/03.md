## Exercise 5: Update the web application to use the new SQL MI database

Duration: 30 minutes

With the `TailspinToys` database now running on SQL MI in Azure, the next step is to make the required modifications to the TailspinToys gamer information web application.

>**Note**: SQL Managed Instance has a private IP address in a dedicated VNet, so to connect an application, you must configure access to the VNet where Managed Instance is deployed. 

### Task 1: Deploy the web app to Azure

In this task, you are using the JumpBox VM and then using Visual Studio on the JumpBox, deploy the `TailspinToysWeb` application into the App Service in Azure.

1. Go to your Lab Environment details page and click on the **Go TO JUMPBOX-SUFFIX** button to launch the VM.

  ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.](media/jumpnew.png "Windows start menu search")
  
2. Once VM launched, open File Explorer by selecting it in the Windows start bar.

   ![The File Explorer icon is highlighted in the Windows start bar.](media/windows-2019-start-bar-file-explorer.png "Windows start bar")

3. In the File Explorer dialog, navigate to the ```C:\hands-on-lab``` folder and then drill down to ```Migrating-SQL-databases-to-Azure-master\Hands-on lab\lab-files```. In the `lab-files` folder, double-click `TailspinToysWeb.sln` to open the solution in Visual Studio.
